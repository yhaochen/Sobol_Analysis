## Instructions to run:
## 1. If you have not already done so, change the working directory to the main 
##    folder 
##    To do so:
##      1. If on RStudio, open the README.md file. Then on the menu bar, go to 
##         Session-->Set Working Directory-->To Source File Location
##      2. If on RStudio, on the lower right box, open the main folder
##         Then, click on More --> Set as Working Directory
##      3. On console, type the following command: 
##         setwd("~/../MAIN_FOLDER") 
## 2. To Run:
##      1. Click on Source button or, on console, type: Source("../../....R")
